# 🌌 **Imagicle – Frontend (Hackathon Project)**

## **Overview**

**Imagicle** is a hackathon project that makes **3D modeling more accessible**. Instead of relying on complex design tools, users can type a natural language prompt (e.g., *“a futuristic robot”*) and instantly generate an interactive 3D model. The model can be **rotated, viewed full screen, and downloaded** in `.ply` format.

* Designed cohesive visuals with **Jersey 15 typography, gradient buttons, and particle background**
* Designed a **Gallery Page concept** in Figma for showcasing generated 3D models → not implemented during the hackathon due to incomplete backend functionality
